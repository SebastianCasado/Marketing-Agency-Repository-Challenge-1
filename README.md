# Marketing-Agency-Repository-Challenge-1
When starting the project I noticed that the "tabs" did not look like you could interact with them, which gave me the idea to use the attribute " cursor: pointer;" in the css file, this made it so that when you hover  your cursor over one of the tabs it would look interactive.

 Which gave me the idea to use javascript to make so that if you click one of the tabs, the information regardingit would pop down, which led me to changing the colors of the tabs when being cliked, which gave it a nice look.

 One of the issues I faced was that when I first started making the code work my way, I kept getting confused with the classes and ID's which made me decide to make my own ID's and classes to be more organized with my self which helped finish this in a neater way.
